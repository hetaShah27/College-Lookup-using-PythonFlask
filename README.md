# College-Lookup-using-PythonFlask
A college locator is developed using Python Flask and HTML templates for ChangingThePresent.org
I currently volunteer at this non-profit organization and contribute my skills to their technical projects. The Flask app supports write-ahead search functionality and is backed by a PostgreSQL database containing data about ~4,000 colleges in the US.
